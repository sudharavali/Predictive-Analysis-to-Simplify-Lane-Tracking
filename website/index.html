      Abstract
    </div>
    <div class="sub_section_text">
      With the growing trends in autonomous vehicles, there is an increased need for computer vision in order to handle
      multiple aspects of the general movement. In the most basic of case, though, computer vision is necessary for the
      detection of lanes in order to allow the vehicle to effectively track
      itself on the road. Though there are many different methods that could be used in order to accomplish this
      they all share the same idea of applying the same algorithm on each frame of the image. We propose a ways of
      simplifying this methodology by using the base algorithm as an early analysis and then using these points to
      generalize the points in the next image.

      Introduction
    </div>
    <div class="sub_section_text">
      The ways in which computer vision can be used in vehicles ranges from actions that effect the direct movement to actions
      those that are used to predict the movements of other vehicles and people. It is growingly seen as essential in the past
      few years as more and more companies invest in this field, seeing it as the new wave of the future, and a step in the
      right direction. In our group we have members who are interested in this sort of research and one member who is directly
      doing research in this field, so we decided that it would be good to take a look at a known algorithm used to do one
      aspect of the computer vision in vehicles, and that is lane detection. Lane detection is widely used and necessary when it
      to autonomous vehicle travel, and there are many algorithms that go about competing for high accuracy while dealing with real
      time speeds. For this we used the paper "Vision-Based Control of a Full-Size Car by Lane Detection" as a reference to the
      current standards used for lane detection. From this paper, and analysing other similar such papers, we discovered that
      they all had a habit of using fast, complex algorithms to amnipulate the images frame by frame. Therefore each new frame
      was taken into consideration as though it were the first in the series, as no information was brought in from the previous
      frame to help the process. This seemed too inefficient as each step of the algorithm would have to be redone each time, though
      multiple steps could be skiped if previous data points were used. Because of this, we decided to implement a method that
      would use the base algorithms as an early detection of the lines, while using a modified and simpler version of the algorithm
      to act on the next frames. By doing this we hope to produce results as good as the original methodology, while cutting down
      on the overall computation time.

      Base Approach
    </div>

    <div class="sub_section_text">
      The approach used for this project was taken from the paper:
    </div>

    <div class="sub_section_text" style="padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px;">
      <a href="https://ece.usu.edu/downloadables/pdfs/student-papers/thesis/2017/Kunz-chase-ms-thesis-2017-A01210672.pdf">
        Vision-Based Control of a Full-Size Car by Lane Detection
      </a>
    </div>

    <div class="sub_section_text" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
      This approach follows six basic steps in order to get lines that need to be detected. The first of these is
      the IPM stage, followed by filtering and thresholding. After this, local maxima are found of the and are used
      to gain lines through line detection. After this spline detection is done on the lines that were found.

            Inverse Perspective Mapping
          </div>
          <div class="sub_section_text">
            The goal of inverse perspective mapping  (IPM)is to give a sort of birds eye view of the entire image, focussing
            on the parts that are more essential of the later algorithms by removing unnecessary scenery. IPM also allows
            for the lanes in the image to become more parralel, allowing for better line detection.

            At this stage, the image that is gained from the previous stage is filtered using the gradient of the horizontal

            highest intensity lines in the image, which should predominantly be the lanes.

            on their proximity to each other. The new cluster centers, generated from the average of the locations in
            the cluster, are then used as the new critical points. Bounding boxes are placed around these lines and
            line fitting is done to get all the possible lines.

              Using the algorithm described in the previous section as a base, we went to look at reducing
              the computing cost by reducing the amount of work done in concurrent frames. In order to do
              this, we started off by running the base algorithm on the first frame. After the points for the
              lanes had been thoroughly obtained, the second frame is then filtered as it was before, but on
              a not IPM transformed image. The detected points in the first frame are then overlayed on top
              of the image from the second frame. Bounding boxes are then created around the overlayed points
              and all the pixels inside this box from the second frame are used as inliers. Spline fitting is
              done again to get the final points for the new lane and extension follows just like before. The
              results of this can be seen on the right and the steps are detailed in the qualitative results.
          </p>
          <p>
            These modifications bring a few advantages right off the bat. The largest of these is the removal
            the IPM stage, Non-Maxima Suppression stage and the line fitting stage from consecutive frames,
            which all encompass large parts of the computations that need to occur. This is especially true for
            the IPM stage as it is computationally heaving and must occur at the beginning and end of the procedure.
            A large reason, we believe that this works is due to the high frame rate of the cameras used on these
            vehicles allowing for the quick progression of the images. This causes little change to occur between
            consecutive frames, allowing for higher accuracy. This sort of modification also helps sort out problems
            that could occur when looking at lanes that have shadows over them, which is a problem that came up
            as we were trying to implement the base system. By using the prior information, you can already gain
            a ball park etimate of where to start and fit the results towards that.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it can be seen by the result on the right, the procedure is accurate and smooth. When testing these
            modifications compared to the base system, we used 50 frames of a car driving on a one lane road. From
            our results we can see that the first takes a much longer time to compute than the frames that follow. This
            shows that the algorithm that we are using does definitely decrease both the computational and time
            costs that are in the base approach alone.
            We attribute part of this to being that the system we are running the process on may not be as powerful
            as the system the authors of the paper use, as well as the fact that the transformation for the IPM is
            the most time and computationally intensive part.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at some of the figures in the base approach section it can be seen that the IPM that we created
            is not as flushed out as the one used in the paper, but it seemed to be able to get the work done for
            what was necessary. The implementation of the IPM, though algorithmically the same, was most likely not
            as optimized as the version used in the paper, and we believe that this could be another reason for such
            a large time difference.

      Conclusion and Future Work
    </div>
    <div class="sub_section_text">
      In the end we can see that there is a great need for lane detection with the growth of autonomous vehicles.
      As new systems develop, it is essential that they are not only accurate, but take a real time and efficient
      manner in order to get the most optimal results. The modifications we have made in this discussion definitely
      try and accomplish this and are well on their way to improving the overall efficiency of the system. There
      are still many complications that can undoubtably occur though. For example, the test on these algorithms were
      done on single lane roads, removing the need to test for otherlanes being detected. There are also no other
      cars or obstacles in the road to demonstrate how these could effect the detection possibilities. To sum it
      all up, its easy to see that there are many different aspects that still need to be taken into consideration
      before work in this field can be considered complete.
